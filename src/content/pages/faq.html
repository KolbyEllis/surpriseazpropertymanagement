                            Yes, we require all tenants to go through a background check. Our background check pulls up everything, if the prospective tenant even has a traffic ticket we'll know about it.

                            The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) prohibits the sharing of credit and background checks with the landlord. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces the FCRA.  We can and will share our findings to you, but we can't share the report.

                            This depends on the type of property and season. Our turnaround to get a quality tenant in the house and moved in usually takes us 2-4 weeks.

                            Ultimately, the decision rests with you. While we can market your property as pet-free, it's important to note that we must adhere to the rules and regulations regarding service animals and emotional support animals. Typically, if you're open to accepting pets, we recommend limiting it to one dog weighing under 25 lbs. However, we approach each situation on a case-by-case basis to ensure it aligns with your preferences and the regulations in place.

                            Absolutely, you have the final say in all decisions regarding your property. It's important to note that as a property management company, we are committed to upholding fair housing laws. So while you have the authority to make decisions, we must also ensure compliance with these regulations. Any property management company that suggests otherwise should be approached with caution.

                            While this situation is rare, it's important to address. If the owner needs to take possession of the property, we typically reach out to the tenant to explain the situation. However, it ultimately depends on the tenant's decision, as they are bound by a legally binding contract that cannot be broken. In some cases, we work with the tenant to find alternative accommodation, and if agreed upon by the owner, they may cover all associated moving costs for the tenant. This may include both move-out and move-in expenses.                        </p>

                            Typically an eviction for non payment takes 3 to 4 weeks.

                            More often than not, an eviction for non payment of rent costs $400 - $600 for the attorney and court costs. We shouldn't profit from an eviction, and therefore only pass those costs on to you. If you hired an attorney to do this yourself, the cost would likely be around $1500 minimum.

                            When a new tenant moves in, we will register that tenant with the HOA and set up our contact info with them for forwarding purposes. Once a violation occurs, we will notifiy you and then send a copy of the voilation to the tenant via both mail and email and work promptly with them to fix the situation. If the tenant receives multiple violations that could prompt us to set up an in person walkthorugh.

The only exception is we always require the owner to be incharge of tree trimming, given the specialized skill and cost involved.

If the investigation reveals that the leak is due to corrosion from hard water, it falls under normal wear and tear, and thus, the responsibility lies with the owner. However, if the leak is determined to be caused by the tenant's misuse, such as disposing harmful substances down the drain, the tenant will be held accountable for the repair costs.
