            <h2 class="cs-title">Our Pricing is very competitive</h2>
            <p class="cs-text">

                We maintain a straightforward fee structure. Our <strong>leasing fee</strong> covers the costs associated with finding a tenant, specifically advertising, and agent agent comissions. Following occupancy, our management fee is a percentage of the rent collected each month.
            </p> 
                
            <p class="cs-text">    
                There are no other
                fees for lease renewal, admin fees, set up fees,
                advertising, etc. It’s very simple, nothing up front and
                once leased the leasing fee comes from the first month
                of rent. When all the misc. fees others charge are
                added into the equation, we are very competitively
                priced. You can find property managers that will
                “manage” your property for $50 per month but cheap is
                not usually your best choice.

            <p class="cs-text">
                My father owned about 70 rental properties and as a
                child I was always around rental homes. My rental
                background was born from helping him with minor
                maintenance issues, and then to full blown rent
                collection for his 70 properties at the age of 16. Once I
                graduated from Missouri Southern State University, I
                immediately started my own company in Missouri in
                1989. For most of the past 20 years I have owned 120
                rental houses myself and managed another 70+ for
                other clients. I have also developed several
                subdivisions, strip malls, and built several hundred
                homes (some of which I kept as rentals for myself).
                Rental homes and property management is all I've
                known all my working life and I am good at it. My wife
                Cindi joined me in the business 12 years ago after our
                youngest started school. Cindi has a remarkable
                personality and does very well with marketing to and
                taking care of the tenants and property management
                clients. </p>

                        We currently rent a property from SunSeeker Rentals. The owners, Ken and Cindi, have taken the time to visit our property, have conversations with us and look out for our best interests. This speaks volumes for the type of people they are. When we have had issues/concerns with the property, every staff member we’ve dealt with has been professional and responds in a timely manner. Their website is easy to use to submit payments, maintenance requests, etc. The service, professionalism and overall general kindness of each staff member has been exceptional!

Everything from the listing to tenancy has so far been smooth with no issues.
