            <p class="cs-text">
                We keep things simple with our straightforward fee structure. Our leasing fee covers the
                costs of finding a tenant, advertising, and agent commissions. Once your property is
                occupied, our management fee is a percentage of the rent collected each month.            
            </p> 
                
            <p class="cs-text">    
                No hidden fees for lease renewals, admin tasks, setup, or advertising. It’s all very
                straightforward: no upfront costs, and the leasing fee comes from the first month's rent.
                When you consider all the miscellaneous fees other companies might charge, we are very
                competitively priced. You might find managers charging less, but remember, you often get
                what you pay for.

            <p class="cs-text">
                Property management is in our family’s DNA. My father owned around 70 rental properties,
                and from a young age, I was by his side, learning the ropes. By 16, I was helping with
                maintenance and managing rent collection for all of the properties.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                After graduating from Missouri Southern State University, I launched my own company in
                Missouri in 1989. Over the past 20 years, I’ve owned 120 rental houses and managed
                another 70+ for other clients. I’ve also developed subdivisions, built strip malls, and
                constructed hundreds of homes, many of which I retained as rentals. Property management
                is something I’ve dedicated my life to perfecting.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Twelve years ago, my wife Cindi joined the business after our youngest started school.
                Cindi’s warmth and marketing experience have been incredible assets. She excels at
                building relationships with our tenants and clients, ensuring everyone feels valued and
                cared for. Together, we bring a personal touch to property management, driven by our family
                heritage and a passion for making every property feel like home.

                        We currently rent a property from SunSeeker Rentals. The owners, Ken and Cindi, have taken the time to visit our property, have conversations with us and look out for our best interests. This speaks volumes for the type of people they are. When we have had issues/concerns with the property, every staff member we’ve dealt with has been professional and responds in a timely manner. Their website is easy to use to submit payments, maintenance requests, etc. The service, professionalism and overall general kindness of each staff member has been exceptional!
