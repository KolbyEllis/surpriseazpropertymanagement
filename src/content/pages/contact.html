                        Ken, Cindi, and their VERY PROFESSIONAL Team are EXACTLY what one wants in a property management company.  On a scale of 1 to 10, we would rate them a 12!!!  From our very first phone conversation 7 years ago, their commitment to excellence has been demonstrated ever since.  They carefully vetted tenants for our PebbleCreek house.  They handled any maintenance issues quickly and cheerfully for both ourselves and for our tenants.  As the property owner, we received detailed monthly accounting immediately after each month closed.  They handle all revenues, monthly expenses, special Arizona taxes and year-end documentation for tax and expense records.

                        When I was looking to purchase an investment property I did a bunch of research of companies in the area. SunSeekers stood out due to their positive reviews and years in business. When I reached out, Ken promptly replied back and provided me with extremely helpful feedback on what types of properties I should be looking for and where I should be looking for them. I was blown away with his professionalism and knowledge. I knew instantly that he was the one I wanted representing me and my property. Ken was nice enough to give me feedback on properties that I was interested in purchasing before I had even become a client and paid for any services. Once I was able to purchase a home, Ken took over the property seamlessly.  He was able to rent it not long after it closed and put a quality renter in. My experience went so well that I'm working on a 2nd  purchase in Glendale AZ location again with help from Ken and his team. I have rentals in other locations and not all managements company are as easy and helpful as SunSeekers have been for me. I am very pleased with Ken and SunSeekers  and would recommend them to anyone!!                    </p>

                        We have had Sunseeker Rentals manage our house in Goodyear for the past 3 years until we just moved into it ourselves. From day one of us contacting them, we have found Ken and Cindi and all staff to be extremely knowledgeable about the rental market in the area. They have found great renters. They have responded quickly to every issue that has arisen at the house, from air conditioning quitting during the summer or from new appliances needed, to palm trees falling and needing hauled away. They always provide a fast quote and got our okay before proceeding. We could always be assured that things would be taken care of in a professional manner. They follow through consistently and thoroughly. They are so accommodating to our needs that we will have them manage the house possibly as a part-time rental and also take care of checking it during the non-rented months of the year. We feel their rates are very fair and there are no surprises. I highly recommend them for rental or property management of any kind.
